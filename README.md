## **About "Conto Specters" 👻**

"Canto Specters: An Exploration of Human Struggles & Passions"

Canto Specters is a mental health and community focused project of 1000 Specters,
Our mission? : to inspire, to awaken and to enlighten!
Canto Specters is a reimagined NFT experience that redefines what it means to be a NFT Project.
In order to create a safe & welcoming space, we are seeking to build a community of participants & contributors who share our values, 
who seek to form bonds, build deeper trust, and promote mental health on the Canto network!


## **About "Song" 🎵**

Attached are the lyrics that we have chosen to feature in Chapter 1, which will introduce a "Canto City" setting, to the "Canto Specters" Storytelling aspect,
that we hope to release on social media for promotion. 
This song is related to the theme of the prologue, and how the main character feels unhappy, and wishes to go to "Canto City" to find something greater then him and a better community.
The storyline features a "Specter" who feels very unhappy with the current town they reside in and wish to take a "train" to "Canto City" (See twitter for more context)
This song is likewise a personal song to the team as it draws in parallels to reflect the idea of how many people in the web 3 currently feel burnt out from the hectic and chaotic of "mainstream chains" and need to leave someplace safe and welcoming (hi canto 😊). 


## **About "App" 📱**

The wireframing for the app is finished, and work on the GUI and functionality of the app has begung. 
Since we want to include a crypto wallet in the application for the tokens earned through the "M2E" mechanism, we have decided to make our App fully open source!
This also fits in the ethos of web 3, and "Don't Trust, Verify", and we have decided to include it in our submission despite it's pre-alpha state.

## **Build Instructions 📱**
The App was written with Flutter;

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.
